•	Instructions from the user are taken by Google assistant application. They have to be in the following way:  
  move forward/back  #	             ( # is distance in cm) 	
  turn left/right  #  degrees        ( #  is angle)           
•	These instructions are sent to IFTTT platform and a response of “moving” or "turning" is sent back to Google assistant application.
•	This instruction is now sent to the Adafruit IO feed “voice commands”.
•	Since Wemos D1 mini(ESP8266) has an access to this adafruit IO account, this command is now read by the microcontroller. 
•	Now according to the instruction read, signals determined by the code are sent to the motor driver.
•	This motor driver controls the motors accordingly.
•	Hence the robot moves as per the given instruction.
